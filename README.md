# boot-camp-12-day-2
Contains all the codes and their tests for second day bootcamp 12 Andelabs:

### 1.The http and web code
This demonstrates a simple command line application that consumes an API using a HTTP client.

In this case, the API chosen is the *i tunes* API.
This function is implemented to enable a user to acquire information on the availability of music-videos from an artist and the price of this content as well as explicitness of the content.

Raw artist names cannot be passed directly as obtained from the user into the Url and thus have to be modified a format compartible with url specifications.

Implementing this code also requires reading of the API documentation to understand how the requests can be made and the various responses.

### 2.The max_and_min
This code finds maximum and minumum numbers in an aray of numbers  and returns both as a list,if all elements in list are equal, then the length of list is returned.

>It relies on the **if_else** logic to make the decisions.

### 3.The word_count
This code counts the number of words in a string and its number of occurances
>It relies on the **if_else logic to execute.
